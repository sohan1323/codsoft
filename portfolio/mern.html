    <p>Socket.IO allows the server to push information to the client in real time, when events occur on the server.

        For example, if you were playing a multiplayer game, an event could be your "friend" scoring a spectacular goal against you.
        
        With Socket.IO, you'd know (almost) instantly about conceding a goal.
        
        Without Socket.IO, the client would have to make multiple polling AJAX calls to verify that the event has occurred on the server. For example, the client could use JavaScript to check for an event on the server every 5 seconds.
        
        Socket.IO means that the client doesn't have to make multiple polling AJAX calls to verify if some event has occurred on the server. Instead, the server sends the info to the client as soon as it gets it. Much better. ðŸ‘Œ</p>
